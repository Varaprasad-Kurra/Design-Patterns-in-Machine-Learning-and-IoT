# Design-Patterns-in-Machine-Learning-and-IoT

In Software Engineering, Design patterns are some of the best practices adopted by software developers while writing source code for new application systems.
Some of the most common problems during the software design stage are redundancy, complexity, and Debugging.
These design patterns can describe the issues, provide a relevant solution, and recommend the appropriate time to apply it. 
It is important to use design patterns because they offer an established solution; if so, followed solves the recurring problem. 
Our review focuses on what design patterns must be used in leading-edge technologies like the Machine learning [1], Internet of Things (IoT), and Deep Learning. 
For example, Machine Learning applications have a pipe and filter design [2] pattern while detecting a cancer cell, whereas Deep Learning has a multi-layered design pattern approach for intrusion detection.
Secured design patterns were developed for IoT software system [3]. We do a systematic study to collect, classify, and discuss these software engineering design patterns in cutting-edge technologies. 
Our review collects software engineering design patterns for IoT, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning techniques to provide developers with a comprehensive classification of such patterns.
